# This simple example on how to do animations using graph-tool. Here we do a
# simple simulation of an S->I->R->S epidemic model, where each vertex can be in
# one of the following states: Susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R). A
# vertex in the S state becomes infected either spontaneously with a probability
# 'x' or because a neighbor is infected. An infected node becomes recovered
# with probability 'r', and a recovered vertex becomes again susceptible with
# probability 's'.

# DISCLAIMER: The following code is definitely not the most efficient approach
# if you want to simulate this dynamics for very large networks, and/or for very
# long times. The main purpose is simply to highlight the animation capabilities
# of graph-tool.
